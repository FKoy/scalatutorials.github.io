<h4>Who am I</h4>

<p>I'm a software engineer who loves to code and build things, experiment with new technologies, and always deepen my learning with existing ones.</p>

<h4>Why blog?</h4>
<p>People (friends colleagues and wife) were tired of me talking about technology all the time, I decided to direct this into a blog, and here is the result.</p>

<h4>What's with Outer Dot?</h4>
<p>
Well, I don't know what it means (yet), it's a random name picked up from: <a href="http://namethingy.com">namethingy.com</a><br>  
Logo was created by the free <a href="http://www.logomaker.com">logomaker.com</a>
</p>

<h4>Other credits</h4>
Monokai CSS from <a href="https://gist.github.com/tobalgists/4007977">this gist by tobalgists</a>
<br>
(And of course Jekyll Bootstrap and Twitter Bootstrap)

<h4>Some links</h4>

Always wanted to put this somewhere (not really):
