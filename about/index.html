<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I'm a software engineer who loves to code and build things, experiment with new technologies, and always deepen my learning with existing ones.</p>

<h3>Why blog?</h3>
<p>People (friends colleagues and wife) were tired of me talking about technology all the time, I decided to direct this into a blog, and here is the result.</p>

<h3>What's with Outer Dot?</h3>
<p>
 honestly, I don't know what it means, it's a random name picked up from: <a href="http://namethingy.com">namethingy.com</a>
