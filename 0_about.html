<h4>Who am I</h4>

<p>I'm a software engineer / developer / hacker / programmer (or however you want to call it) who loves to code and build things, experiment with new technologies, and always deepen my learning with existing ones.</p>


<h4>What's with the logo?</h4>
<p>
<!--Well, I don't know what it means (yet), it's a random name picked up from: <a href="http://namethingy.com">namethingy.com</a><br>  -->
Not sure yet, but it was created by the free <a href="http://www.logomaker.com">logomaker.com</a>
</p>

<h4>Other credits</h4>
Monokai CSS from <a href="https://gist.github.com/tobalgists/4007977">this gist by tobalgists</a>

(And of course Jekyll Bootstrap and Twitter Bootstrap)
